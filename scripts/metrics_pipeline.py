TODO: make a big, nice pipeline that takes in one input file & runs it
through Confounded, ComBat, and SVA, saves those output files, and
calculates the following metrics:
- how long did it take?
- for each algorithm, what's the MSE (before - after)?
- what is our Random Forests & SVA accuracy for batch before & after?
- what is our "" accuracy for true signal before & after?
